# Divination-Loves

About The Project:

Inspired by the Magic Eight Ball, this divination focuses on your luck in love! 

The user inputs a question that they might have pertaining to love. The Love Ball outputs one answer out of twenty. They can ask as many questions as 
they want. 

Process:
Growing up, I vividly remember sitting with my cousins and alternating asking the Magic 8 Ball questions. Because of how superstitious my grandparents 
were, I myself ended up adopting the same mindset. While I don't necessarily believe in these things, I tend to keep any sort of response I get from 
these types of devices in the back of my mind. 

While I usually create more 'heavy' works, I wanted to take this opportunity to create something a little more fun and lighthearted, especially in light 
of recent events. I felt like choosing a topic related to love allowed me to use brighter, more vibrant colors that made me feel a little more whole. 

However, my initial idea was incredibly different than this. I wanted to create something inspired by the connect the dots game. For this project, I 
planned to create a divination tool that helps you find your constellation (as well as your song of the day). The interface will resemble those old 
'Connect the dots!' activities we used to do when we were young. The website will prompt the user to join the dots in any way they would like. 
Afterwhich, a particular constellation (mostly the zodiac constellations) that slowly resembles the pattern they draw will be outputted, alongside 
its corresponding song. The website would function as a light and informative one. It'll allow users to learn more about the different constellations 
while simultaneously giving them an easy activity to play! 

Nevertheless, I struggled a lot with trying to put a work area on an entire canvas as opposed to an image, so I decided to create something else. 
My next idea was inspired by the 'he loves me, he loves me not' game. While I did love the idea initially, I didn't feel particularly inspired by it, 
so I decided to switch.. again. 

Reflection:
I still aim to improve on so many things regarding this website. 
1. I want it to be so that the user can only click on the 'ask me' button once (the button disappears after) 
2. Hearts to animate out of the love bomb
3. The user to be able to download and share their responses
